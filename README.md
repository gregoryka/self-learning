# Self Learning Materials
This contains my personal learning materials, focused mostly on HPC techs. Made so I don't forget different stuff I come across and want to look into.

## Compilers
This is a avery non-exhaustive list of different compilers. A modern compiler includes optimizations that may improve code execution, so this should be up to date.

 - GCC - The De-facto compiler for linux based systems.
 - Clang - A C family compiler based on LLVM. Made to be very modular, and thus be easy to add new languages to.
